Simple Complexities is a math blog to collect and share with you stuff that I've learnt. The focus is on simplifying a lot of the jargon-filled and abstruse math I've come across into a more intuitive form.
Right now, most of the posts are focussed on linear algebra and graphs, but I hope to add more on optimization and other research I'm interested in.

Comments are available via GitHub Issues, in order to not clutter up this space here. Comment [here](https://github.com/simple-complexities/simple-complexities.github.io/issues/)!
